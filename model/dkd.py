"""Export-safe re-implementation of ALIKE's DKD keypoint detector.

What had to change, and why
---------------------------
The upstream detector (`gluefactory/models/extractors/alike_sddh.py::DKD`) is
written for training: it loops over the batch in Python, uses `nn.Unfold` to
materialise a `(B, 25, H*W)` patch tensor, writes the border mask **in place**,
and samples the keypoint score with `F.grid_sample`.  Of those, two are hard
blockers for an NPU:

1. `F.grid_sample` - not NPU-executable, falls back to CPU (see `gather_ops.py`).
2. `nn.Unfold` - lowers to `Im2Col`, which is not an ONNX/RKNN operator.  It is
   also enormously wasteful here: it builds 25 x H x W floats per image to then
   read only 25 values at each of 512 keypoints.

This module replaces both.  The neighbour window is gathered by index arithmetic
(one `Gather`), and the score lookup goes through `GatherSample`.  Everything
else - the two NMS rounds, the border zeroing, top-k, and the temperature-0.1
soft-argmax - is reproduced op-for-op.

What is deliberately NOT reproduced
-----------------------------------
`detect_keypoints` also returns `scoredispersitys`, which `ALikeSDDH._forward`
immediately discards (`keypoints, _, kptscores = ...`).  Computing it would cost
a 25-wide norm and a reduction per keypoint for a value nothing reads, so it is
omitted.  `forward` below returns `(keypoints_px, scores)` only.

Numerical contract
------------------
* The border mask is applied with `torch.where`, not in-place assignment.  Scores
  are sigmoid outputs in (0, 1) so `x * 0` would also work, but `where` is exactly
  equivalent to assignment and cannot be wrong for a negative or NaN input.
* Neighbour indices are clamped.  ALIKE zeroes a `radius + 1 = 3` px border
  before top-k, so a surviving keypoint sits at least 3 px from every edge and a
  +/-2 window can never leave the map.  The clamp is therefore a no-op safety net
  and layer L1 of the parity protocol confirms it does not change a single value.
* Keypoints are returned in PIXELS.  The upstream detector returns normalised
  [-1, 1] and the extractor converts back with `wh * (kp + 1) / 2`; doing the
  conversion here removes two ops from the exported graph and cannot change the
  result because the conversion is exact arithmetic on the same numbers.

def simple_nms(scores: torch.Tensor, nms_radius: int) -> torch.Tensor:
    """ALIKE's `simple_nms`, rewritten in FLOAT arithmetic for the NPU.

    Upstream is written with boolean tensors:

        max_mask  = scores == max_pool(scores)                 # bool
        supp_mask = max_pool(max_mask.float()) > 0             # bool
        max_mask  = max_mask | (new_max_mask & (~supp_mask))   # And / Or / Not

    Two changes were forced by measurement, not by taste:

    * **The `Or`/`And`/`Not` chain does not lower to the NPU.**  The RKNN build
      reports `No lowering found for: node_bitwise_or, node type = Or, use
      CustomOperatorLower instead`, and the simulator then disagrees with the
      reference by 484 px on keypoints.  Boolean logic has to become arithmetic:
      a 0/1 float mask with `or -> a + b - a*b` (clamped) and `and -> a * b`.
      That is exact for 0/1 operands, and it is what makes the graph NPU-native.
    * **`>=` replaces `==`.**  `max_pool` can only return a value already present
      in the window, so `scores <= max_pool(scores)` always holds and
      `scores >= max_pool(scores)` is therefore exactly equivalent to equality -
      while `Equal` is a less reliably lowered operator than a comparison.

    Everything else (two fixed rounds, the same pooling kernel, the same final
    `where(mask, scores, 0)`) is unchanged, and `where(mask, s, 0)` becomes
    `s * mask` because scores are sigmoid outputs and therefore non-negative.

    The loop stays unrolled: the round count is a constant, so the graph is a
    fixed sequence of `MaxPool`/`GreaterOrEqual`/`Cast`/`Mul`/`Sub`/`Clamp`
    nodes with no control flow - which is what RKNN requires.
