"""Stage 1 - ALIKE backbone + DKD + descriptor sampling, as ONE exportable graph.

Input   image        (B, 3, S, S) float32 in [0, 1]   (S = 512, a multiple of 32)
Output  keypoints    (B, K, 2)     float32, PIXELS
        descriptors  (B, K, 128)   float32, L2-normalised per keypoint
        scores       (B, K)        float32, keypoint confidence

Why one graph and not three
---------------------------
The three outputs come from one forward pass over a full-resolution dense map.
Splitting them would re-run the backbone or force the 128-channel map through
host memory (2 x 512 x 512 x 128 x 4 B = 268 MB per call at float32, which the
measurements in the speedup notes show is the dominant cost on a PCIe host).
Keeping it fused means the dense map never leaves the NPU.

Descriptor source
-----------------
This deployment uses ALIKE's **own** `convhead2` descriptors
(`descriptor_source: alike`), NOT the SDDH head.  The SDDH head is therefore not
part of this module and its weights are not exported - see `load_from_checkpoint`
for how the checkpoint's unused head is skipped.

            is a CONTINUOUS function of the keypoint position.  This matters for
            portability: on an fp16 NPU the keypoint itself is only accurate to
            about 0.043 px (per-pair median over 8 HPatches pairs), and with
            "floor" a jitter of that size that

            adjacent pixels of the L2-normalised map sit at cosine mean 0.859,

            reference dump: minimum cosine 0.54 with "floor" versus 0.90 with

        "floor" - upstream ALIKE's rule (`.long()` indexing).  Kept, because it
            is what the released weights were trained with, so any accuracy claim
