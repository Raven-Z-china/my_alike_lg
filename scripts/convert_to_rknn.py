"""ONNX -> RKNN conversion with a three-layer operator audit.

Run in the `rknn` environment (rknn-toolkit2 on an x86 host; the target board is
not needed for conversion or for numeric validation).

Why three checks and not one
----------------------------
A single "did it convert" signal is not trustworthy:

  1. LOAD  - `rknn.load_onnx()` parses the graph and hard-fails on operators it
             cannot map at all.  Necessary, not sufficient.
  2. BUILD - operators the NPU cannot execute are reported as "not support" and
             silently scheduled on the CPU.  The model still builds and still
             runs; it is just slow, and on a board without the CPU fallback
             runtime it fails at inference.  Every such line is captured and
             surfaced, because this is the failure mode that matters here -
             the entire point of the round/clip/gather rewrite was to avoid it.
  3. NUMERIC - the PC simulator is run against the torch reference.  An operator
             that is "supported" but lowered incorrectly shows up here.

Static shapes are mandatory
---------------------------
RKNN requires fixed dimensions.  Both stages are exported static, so
`--batch`/`--size` here must match the export, and are only used to shape the
dummy input for the normalisation config.

Input conventions
-----------------
stage 1  uint8 NHWC, normalised on the NPU (`mean=0, std=255`), so the model sees
         exactly `image_u8 / 255` - bit-identical to the float input the torch
         reference used.  No float preprocessing is needed in C++.
stage 2  float32 inputs, no normalisation (`mean=0, std=1`); the descriptors are
         already L2-normalised by stage 1.
`--dtype i8` additionally quantises (int8).  That path is reported separately and
is expected to lose accuracy; it is never the default.

    THE VERBOSITY IS NOT JUST COSMETIC - IT DECIDES WHAT THE AUDIT CAN SEE
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------
    Two independent things have to be right for this audit to mean anything, and
    both were wrong at some point in this project.

    1. THE STREAM.  The toolkit writes its log from C++ to file descriptor 1:

       * `redirect_stdout` replaces `sys.stdout`, a Python object.  It cannot
         intercept a write made by native code.  Measured: 0 bytes captured while
         the build emitted 1.2 MB - so the audit was reading an empty string and
         reporting a clean graph.
       * `contextlib.redirect_stderr` fails the same way.
       * The fd itself must be redirected, to a temporary file, for the duration
         of the call.  The file is read back afterwards and the original fd
         restored in a `finally` so an exception cannot leave stdout pointing at
         a deleted file.
       * fd 2 is folded into the same file as well: the toolkit splits severity
         levels across both streams, and reading only one is the same bug wearing
         a different costume.

    2. THE LOG LEVEL, AND WHEN IT IS SET.  Measured on this exact graph, same
       toolkit, three ways of asking for the log:

           RKNN(verbose=False)                        480,129 bytes    0 warnings
           RKNN(verbose=False) + later set_log_level  866,686 bytes    0 warnings
           RKNN(verbose=True)                       1,216,961 bytes   36 warnings

       Only the third reports the 36 `Transpose will fallback to CPU` nodes.  The
       other two are not merely quieter - they OMIT the warnings, so an audit
       reading them sees a graph with no fallbacks.  The earlier version of this
       script built quietly and therefore reported a clean graph that had 36 nodes
       on the host.

       The post-hoc setter is the trap: it visibly raises the level (the log grows
       from 480 kB to 867 kB) while still not emitting the warnings.  `verbose` has
       to reach the CONSTRUCTOR, because `RKNN.__init__` is where
       `set_log_level_and_file_path` is called.  So the callers here construct with
       `verbose=True`, and `--show-all` no longer exists - there is no reason to
       build quietly, since fd 1/2 are diverted to a file and the 1.2 MB of
       progress bars never reaches a terminal.

    Note the log is mostly progress bars; only the interesting lines are extracted
    from it, and only those are printed unless `--verbose`.

    WHY THIS IS NOT A ONE-LINE GREP
    -------------------------------
    Three separate ways this went wrong in this project, in the order they were
    discovered:

    1. The pattern list had no `node type = <Op>` alternative.  The RKNN loader
       refused a graph with a Python traceback and the audit printed nothing -
       a false clean result.
    2. The unique-LINE set has one entry per op TYPE, so it bounded the report at
       "2" for a graph with 29 offending nodes.  Counting NODES is what decides
       whether a rewrite is worth doing.
    3. `Unkown op target: 0` was treated as a fallback.  It is not: target 0 is
       `RKNN_NPU_CORE_AUTO`, so the line is emitted for every AUTO-masked node
       including the ones that are happily on the NPU.  Treating it as a failure
       reported 39 fallbacks for a stage-1 graph that has none, which would have
       sent the whole optimisation pass chasing a phantom.

    So the return value separates them, and `real` is the only number that may
    drive a decision.
